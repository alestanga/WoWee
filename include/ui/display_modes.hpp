// display_modes.hpp - the resolutions this client offers, in one place.
//
// Both interfaces put a resolution picker on the same window. This client's
// settings panel had the list inside the function that drew it, and FrameXML's
// video panel asked GetScreenResolutions, which answered the current size and
// nothing else - a dropdown with one entry, whose SetScreenResolution did
// nothing anyway. Sharing the list rather than writing a second one, because
// the *position* in it is the protocol: the video panel's dropdown carries an
// index, not a size, and hands that index back to SetScreenResolution.
//
// The list is built for the device it is running on, because a fixed list of
// desktop modes is the wrong list on a tablet. A tablet's window cannot be
// resized, so a resolution chosen there is the size the world is *drawn* at
// and the upscaler scales it onto the screen. The entries that make sense
// there are the screen's own size and fractions of it - and they are read
// from the screen, not written down, so the list is right on any device.
