"""Cut an extracted Data directory down to something a phone can hold.

A full extraction is about 18 GB. The Android build cannot ask a player to copy
that onto a device, and does not need to: reaching the login screen and creating
a character touches a fraction of it.

This reads manifest.json, which is the client's index of everything it can open,
keeps the entries a profile allows, links or copies those files into a new
directory, and writes a manifest describing only what it kept. The client finds
its data root by looking for manifest.json, so a subset without one is not a
smaller install, it is a broken one.

Profiles live in data_profiles.json.

    ./make_minimal_data.py --source ~/Data --out ~/Data-ek --profile world --maps azeroth
    ./make_minimal_data.py --source ~/Data --profile world --dry-run

--dry-run reports the size and touches nothing.
