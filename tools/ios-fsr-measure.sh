# Measure the iPad's frame time with and without FSR1 upscaling.
#
# Run this from Opencode on the Mac, with the iPad connected and unlocked.
# It does the whole comparison: push a config, play, pull the log, and print
# the numbers side by side.

#   tools/ios-fsr-measure.sh --udid <udid>
#   tools/ios-fsr-measure.sh --udid <udid> --quality 1     # 0.77 scale
#   tools/ios-fsr-measure.sh --udid <udid> --only fsr1     # skip the baseline
#
# What it measures, and why:
#
# The client logs a "frame budget over Ns: X frames, Y fps" line every ten
# seconds (Application::reportStageTimes) with a per-stage breakdown, and a
# "SLOW render stage 'endFrame'" line for any stage over 50 ms. The stage
# breakdown is the answer: on the iPad every stage was under 50 ms except
# endFrame, which sat at 75-80 ms. endFrame is post-process, the UI overlay,
# submit and the present wait - so it is the GPU being the bottleneck, and
# the only fix is to give it fewer pixels.
#
# FSR1 renders the scene at a fraction of the swapchain size and upscales
# into it. That is a render scale, which is what the resolution selector
# cannot be on iPad: SDL's UIKit backend has no SetWindowSize, so the
# window stays at the native 2360x1640 whatever the resolution setting says.
#
# The profile lines are logged at INFO unless WOWEE_FRAME_PROFILE is set, and
# the default log level is WARNING in a release build. A Debug build logs at
# INFO by default, so the breakdown is already in the log - no env var
# needed, and none can be set on iOS anyway.
#
# If you built Release, the "frame budget" and per-stage lines will be
# missing and only the "SLOW render stage" warnings survive. The warning is
# enough to see whether endFrame is still the stage that dominates, but the
# fps number needs a Debug build.
